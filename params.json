{"name":"Centaurus","tagline":"First Stellar Wallet for Android","body":"#Centaurus\r\n\r\n## The First Stellar Wallet for Android!\r\n\r\nStellar aims for the stars. And the nearest star system to us is Alpha Centauri!\r\nThe next step to get there is a functional app for sending and receiving payments (starting with STR, only).\r\n\r\nThe app is built using AngularJS, Cordova and the Ionic Framework. We first focus on android, but as Ionic is a platform agnostic tool, feel free to try it on the platform you like.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Display account balance and recent transactions\r\n* Send STR (paste address or scan QR-code)\r\n* Receive STR (generate QR-code)\r\n* Lock sending by local password\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nI am a complete newbee to HTML/JS, Ionic, so \r\n* just contribute new code\r\n* peer review and improve existing code\r\n* Donate to our Stellar-Address `gEux6NhrybVLuvgaYrgThTk4d3Kmd3s4NP` (need 25$ for upload to Playstore)\r\n\r\n## Levels of Contribution\r\n\r\nThere is a simple way for contribution as long as you don't develop on phone specific issues. \r\n\r\nWhile the simple mode is a good way to get started, you will soon want to see this on your own device. Or check the layout on several emulated devices or whatever.\r\n\r\n### Simple \r\n\r\n* [Fork project](https://github.com/klopper/Centaurus) as usual.\r\n* Open file './www/index.html' with your browser. What you see is close to what you have in the app.\r\n* Modify the html views in './www/templates/' or the JS files in './www/js/'. Watch your changes immediatly by refreshing the page in the browser. \r\n* You might also want to add some JS libs to './www/lib/'.\r\n* See [www/Readme.md](https://github.com/klopper/Centaurus/blob/master/www/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Advanced (Android)\r\n\r\n* [Install Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/). The [video tutorial for Windows users](http://learn.ionicframework.com/videos/windows-android/) is quite comprehensive\r\n* [Fork project](https://github.com/klopper/Centaurus) as usual.\r\n* Make sure your device is visible to your computer. You can check this by running ```adb devices```. More information coming soon.\r\n* Navigate to your Centaurus root folder in the command line, use ionic to add android platform\r\n* Build, deploy and run the app. Be Happy!\r\n```bash\r\nionic platform android\r\nionic run android\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Advanced (other platforms)\r\n\r\nNo experience yet, so let us know.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n* [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)\r\n* [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/)\r\n* ...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
